Logox 4 Demo App
================

The Logox 4 Demo App setup ships with one voice (Bill),
but when you install more voices (e.g. via the WebSpeech setup),
it will be able to detect and use them.


Features
--------

* A text input box for user-supplied text to be read.
  In the version I was able to find, text being typed and/or pasted into
  that box is limited to 200 characters.

* Highlights the word that is being spoken.

* The "open file" is limited as well: Instead of a text file open dialog,
  it only offers a collection of some example texts.
  * Those are not affected by the input length limit.
  * Some of the examples are useful to learn about the Logox speech tags.
  * The example texts are stored in plain text near the end of the file,
    so you can conveniently review them even without running the demo app.
